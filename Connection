### 🔋 1. Power Supply Requirements by Component

Component	Voltage	Current Needed	Notes

Arduino UNO	7–12V	~50–250mA	Can accept 9V battery or 5V regulated to VIN
NodeMCU (ESP8266)	5V	~200–300mA peak	Needs stable 5V to 3.3V LDO onboard
SIM800L	3.7–4.2V	≥2A peak	Can cause brownout if undervoltaged
DFPlayer Mini	3.2–5V	~50–100mA	Needs clean 5V to avoid noise
ESP32-CAM	5V	≥500mA	Brownouts are common if not isolated
GPS Module	3.3–5V	~30–50mA	Works off Arduino 5V
Sensors (MQ6, flame, PIR)	5V	~20–50mA each	Minimal draw

### ✅ 2. Power Design Recommendations

🔌 A. Dual Power Supply Model (Safe & Efficient)

Path	Supply Method	What It Powers

🔋 Power Path A	2x 18650 Li-ion (7.4V) + Buck Converter to 5V	Arduino, DFPlayer, GPS, sensors
🔋 Power Path B	Separate 3.7V Li-ion + AMS1117 or LM2596 to 4.0V	SIM800L
🔌 NodeMCU	USB power bank or same 5V output (min 2A)	NodeMCU & ESP32-CAM


> ⚠️ Keep SIM800L and ESP32-CAM on isolated regulators to avoid brownouts during high draw (SIM startup, camera init).

### 🔄 4. Battery Backup & Auto Switch (Optional)

You can use:

TP4056 module with protection for charging 18650 batteries.

Diodes or relays to auto-switch to battery if external power fails.



---

### 🔋 5. Recommended Components

Module	Use

LM2596 Buck Converter	7.4V to 5V for Arduino path
AMS1117 3.3/4.0V Regulator	3.7V to 4.0V for SIM800L
TP4056 BMS Charger	Recharge 18650 safely
2A+ Power Bank	Stable 5V to NodeMCU



---

### 🧪 6. Final Checks Before Deployment

✅ Add power indicator LED
✅ Use fuses or polyfuses for safety
✅ Test each power rail independently
✅ Use heat sinks for linear regulators if needed
✅ Ensure total current budget does not exceed supply
